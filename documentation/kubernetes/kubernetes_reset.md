Below is a concise, step‐by‐step guide to completely reset your Kubernetes installation so you can start fresh. **Note:** These steps will remove all your cluster state, including control plane certificates, etcd data, and any running containers or configurations. Make sure you’ve backed up any important data before proceeding.

---

### **Step 1: Reset the Cluster Using kubeadm**

Run the following command on your master node:

```bash
sudo kubeadm reset -f
```

- This command will remove the Kubernetes cluster configuration from your node, delete static pod manifests (typically in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`), and clean up control plane certificates (usually in `/etc/kubernetes/pki`).

---

### **Step 2: Remove Remaining Kubernetes Configuration Directories**

Clean up any leftover Kubernetes files and directories:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/kubernetes
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/etcd
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/kubelet
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cni
rm -rf ~/.kube
```

- This deletes all configuration files, certificates, etcd data, and your local kubeconfig files.

---

### **Step 3: Clean Up Container Runtime Artifacts**

If you’re using containerd (or another container runtime), clean up any remaining containers and images:

1. **Remove all containers:**

   ```bash
   sudo crictl rm --all
   ```

2. **Remove all images:**

   ```bash
   sudo crictl rmi --all
   ```

*(If you are using Docker instead of containerd, you can use:)*

```bash
sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -aq)
sudo docker rmi $(sudo docker images -q)
```

---

### **Step 4: Flush iptables and Clean Up Networking Rules**

Reset any iptables rules that might interfere with the new setup:

```bash
sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -t nat -F
```

- This clears any old rules that could affect container networking.

---

### **Step 5: Reboot the Machine**

Rebooting ensures that all lingering processes are stopped and the system starts with a clean slate:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After the reboot, verify that the Kubernetes directories, containers, and configurations have been removed.

---

Once the system is clean, you can proceed with reinitializing your cluster using `kubeadm init` and reapplying your pod network plugin (e.g., Calico).
